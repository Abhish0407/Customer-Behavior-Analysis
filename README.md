## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **Python** – for loading, cleaning, and analyzing data (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* **MySQL** – for writing and running SQL queries, joins, and aggregations
* **Power BI** – for building an interactive dashboard
* **Gamma** – for creating an automated PPT report
* **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code** – for Python scripting

## ⚙️ Steps / Workflow

1. **Data Loading:** Imported dataset into Python using Pandas.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, duplicates, and data type inconsistencies.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

   * Analyzed key statistics and relationships.
   * Visualized patterns and correlations using Python libraries.
4. **Database Integration:**

   * Loaded cleaned data into **MySQL**.
   * Executed SQL queries for segmentation, trend, and performance analysis.
5. **Dashboard Creation:**

   * Built a **Power BI dashboard** showing KPIs, category insights, and purchase trends.
6. **Reporting:**

   * Used **Gamma** to automatically create a presentation summarizing key findings.
